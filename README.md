# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of the analysis: 
This new assignment consists of three technical analyses. 

Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

## Results: 
In the first deliverable, I wrote code to scrape Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles from another website.  The code can be found here:

In the second deliverable, my scraping code retrieved the full-resolution image URL and tlte for each hemisphere image, stored it in MongoDB and then updated the web app to display all the scraped data.

After scraping has been completed, the web app contained all the information from the module and the full resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.

In the third deliverable, I needed to add 2 bootstrap components to make my page pop and also needed to make my site mobile responsive.  This was achieved by adding some color to the header and button: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100737452/168402514-4032943e-0c57-42a9-92c1-980ceb05866c.png)


Here are the results of mobile responsiveness:
